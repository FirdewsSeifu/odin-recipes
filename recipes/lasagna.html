        <p>You can easily lighten up lasagna and save a decent amount of dollars by using cottage cheese instead of ricotta — you still get that same taste and comfort, but it's not as overwhelmingly filling and can be much easier to digest for people with minor dairy sensitivities. Blend the cottage cheese with a mixer beforehand so it'll have a consistency closer to ricotta.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, cook beef until brown. Drain off all fat. Add onion and cook until translucent. Add tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, water, oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and sugar. Stir until combined and cook over medium heat until boiling. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. 
            <li>While sauce is simmering, blend cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg until smooth. Set aside. 
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. 
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            <li>Spread 1 cup of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover sauce with 3 noodles. Cover noodles with 1/3 of the remaining sauce. Top with 1/2 of the mozzarella. Place another layer of noodles and one of sauce over the mozzarella; top that with the cottage cheese mixture. Top with remaining 3 noodles and remaining sauce. 
            <li>Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella on top and bake 15 minutes more, until golden and bubbly.
